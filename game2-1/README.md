<DESCRIPTION>
LET'S KICK THE SHELL -> 
Mission: Escape from the sewers
Story:
After the evil Shredder has taken over the city and imprisoned it in a dungeon, our heroes, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello, find themselves trapped in a tangled sewer system. They will have to overcome many obstacles to break free and save the city from the sinister rule of Schroeder and his gang of ninja apprentices.
Game 1: Tank
The turtles encounter Shredder's ninja apprentices on their path, who try to thwart them. Players control a tank and must destroy the enemies from the platform using powerful blows.
Game 2: Sumo
To strengthen their skills and prepare for the final battle with Shredder, the turtles have a sumo battle with each other. Players must use their strength and agility to push their opponent out of the arena and win.
Game 3: Guess Two Identical Cards
There are various items and artifacts scattered in the sewers. The turtles must find the paired cards to solve the code and open the doors leading to the next level.
Game 4: Jump Over the Obstacle
Various obstacles such as pits and ledges, as well as traps set by Shredder, are encountered along the path of the turtles. Players must control the turtles' jumps to avoid colliding with the obstacles and continue their journey.


<GAME OPTIONS>
4 multi games were made by classes to work with sprites , there were difficulties with connecting all 4 games into one game and the interval between them.


<CONCLUSION>
After the Turtles are able to defeat Shredder and his army, they will finally be freed from the dark recesses of the sewers and emerge into the bright light of the city streets. Their victory will not only be a liberation of the city from tyranny, but also a symbol of strength, unity and belief in the triumph of good over evil. With heads proudly raised and hearts filled with hope, they will begin a new chapter of their adventure, returning to the city they promised to protect and serve.
