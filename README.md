After the Turtles are able to defeat Shredder and his army, they will finally be freed from the dark recesses of the sewers and emerge into the bright light of the city streets. Their victory will not only be a liberation of the city from tyranny, but also a symbol of strength, unity and belief in the triumph of good over evil. With heads proudly raised and hearts filled with hope, they will begin a new chapter of their adventure, returning to the city they promised to protect and serve.<br>
